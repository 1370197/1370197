## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm U.G student interested in the boundaries of dimensions and studying the limits of our current mathematics and physics in higher dimensions 

I love playing chess ,my favourite chess player being Mikhail Tal 

https://www.chessgames.com/perl/chesscollection?cid=1029595 

the above games are really cool and studying it is a very good way for players who would love to improve their combination skills and quick calcs during the game (smart sacrifices and educated gambles)


i love watching horror movies (pls reccomend me some cool non popular ones)

here are some really cool articles on science 

1)why are maxwells equations so hard to understand ? https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/em/dyson.pdf
https://replicationindex.com/2020/12/30/a-meta-scientific-perspective-on-thinking-fast-and-slow/

2)A History of Dark Matter -https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04909

3)Anomalies in High Energy Physics https://hepcomm.github.io/hepmist/

4)Failed Theories of Superconductivity - https://arxiv.org/abs/1008.0447


PROFILE:
# Hello im 137 (tryin ta not reveal my actual name obviously),i am a sophomore undergraduate student whose main interest lies in theoretical and mathematical physics i also love computational physics and electronics my main research interest lies in hyperspace and study of higher dimensions , I got interested in the concept of time and dimensions when i first read The time machine https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Time-Machine by H.G Wells the idea of the quantum world and its fascinations were introduced to me when i read Alice in Quantum land and The ghost in the atom


## projects
Sadly i dont have any completed projects ,but in my basket case are some p fun projects 

1)1)Building a 6502 computer (i know i shd build a 8cpu processor first ,heavily inspired by Ben Eater

2)trying to create a small invisible cloak by designing retro reflective technology (except optimising it using polariserz

3)This is purely mathematical but ,:Proving Schrodinger's wave equation

4)computing the potential energy of a nacl lattice structure using neovim
