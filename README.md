Hello im 137 (tryin ta not reveal my actual name obviously),i am a sophomore undergraduate student whose main interest lies in theoretical and mathematical physics 
at this point im not quite set on choosing a specilisation but my eyes are on theoretical and particle physics ,ive not yet completed any projects but below are a set of projects ive been working on none of it are even close to being completed but hopefully someday i would complete it
1)Building a 6502 computer (i know i shd build a 8cpu processor first ,heavily inspired by ben eater 
2)trying to create a small invisible cloak by designing retro reflective technology (except optimising it using polarisers)
3)this is purely mathematical but ,:Proving Schrodinger's wave equation
4)computing the potential energy of a nacl lattice structure using neovim

INTERESTS:
1)differential geometry and complex analysis , linear regression of vectors 
2)Analysis of hyperspace and string theory
3)Dark matter 
4)Precision experiments
5)Standard quantum field theory

Some fun Research ideas:
1)Relativity for higher dimensional entities 
2)Universe as a N dimensional superfluid
3)The warp drive (kinda fantasy ik)
4)Multiverse in an inverted island


I do like to play chess , my fav documentary is cosmos : a spacetime odyssey

here are some cool articles  :
1) why are maxwells equations so hard to understand ? https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/em/dyson.pdf
2) https://replicationindex.com/2020/12/30/a-meta-scientific-perspective-on-thinking-fast-and-slow/
3) A History of Dark Matter -https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04909
4) Anomalies in High Energy Physics https://hepcomm.github.io/hepmist/
5) Failed Theories of Superconductivity - https://arxiv.org/abs/1008.0447
